Deep learning has gained more interest and attention in comparison to machine learning in the recent years. It has been successfully applied to many applications of real world to solve problems on a daily basis. Time series forecasting for the stock market is the most challenging area in the time series forecasting domain. In this project, we propose the use of deep learning technique in stock price forecasting and compare the same with machine learning technique. We present hybrid models of auto-regressive integrated moving average support vector machine and auto-regressive integrated moving average gated recurrent unit respectively. The closing stock prices act as inputs for the auto-regressive integrated moving average model that gives residuals of the same as output. The residuals along with the original closing stock prices are used to compute the new closing stock prices, that is put to the deep learning and machine learning models respectively, to predict the next dayâ€™s closing price. By experimentation, we are able to conclude that auto-regressive integrated moving average gated recurrent unit is able to give a better accuracy in comparison to auto-regressive integrated moving average support vector machine on long term forecasting of the closing price of stock for a large data taken from the Indian National Stock Exchange.
